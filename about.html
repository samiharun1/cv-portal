            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a passionate full-stack .NET developer who loves problem-solving and building meaningful projects. Whether it’s designing robust back-end systems or creating intuitive front-end experiences, I enjoy the challenge of turning complex problems into elegant, functional solutions. My curiosity drives me to continuously learn and improve, staying up to date with the latest technologies and best practices.

                Beyond software development, I have a strong background in leadership, particularly in recreational activities and youth development. I have experience managing and organizing youth centers, where I focus on creating engaging programs and safe spaces that allow young people to learn, grow, and develop essential life skills. By fostering a positive and inclusive environment, I help guide and support young individuals in their personal and professional journeys.
                
                In addition to my work in technology and youth leadership, I am also an entrepreneur. I have founded multiple companies in various industries, including fitness and health, e-commerce distribution, and social media marketing. These ventures have given me valuable insights into business development, branding, and the importance of strong team leadership. I thrive in dynamic environments where I can identify opportunities, take calculated risks, and bring innovative ideas to life.
                
                What truly drives me is the ability to create opportunities—whether that means developing cutting-edge software, launching a new business, or building a community where people feel inspired and empowered. I believe that success is not just about personal achievements, but also about the impact we make on others. Through collaboration, strategic thinking, and a passion for continuous growth, I strive to contribute to meaningful projects that leave a lasting impression..</p>
