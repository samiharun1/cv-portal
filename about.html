            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a passionate full-stack .NET developer who loves problem-solving and building meaningful projects. I am also a driven leader in recreational activities and youth development, with experience in managing and organizing youth centers. Through strategic leadership and collaboration, I create safe and inspiring environments where young people can grow and thrive.
                 In addition to this, I am an entrepreneur and have founded several companies, including ventures in fitness and health, e-commerce distribution, and a social media agency. My experience in business development, marketing, and team leadership has strengthened my ability to turn ideas into reality. I am passionate about creating opportunities—whether it’s building businesses, 
                 developing organizations, or empowering the next generation.</p>
